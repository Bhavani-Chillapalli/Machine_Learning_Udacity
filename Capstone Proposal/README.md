# Capstone Project Proposal - TGS Salt Identification Challenge 

## Capstone Domain 

Several areas of Earth with large accumulations of oil and gas also have huge deposits of salt below the surface.
But unfortunately, knowing where large salt deposits are precisely is very difficult. Professional seismic imaging still requires expert human interpretation of salt bodies. This leads to very subjective, highly variable renderings. More alarmingly, it leads to potentially dangerous situations for oil and gas company drillers.
Imaging salt has been a huge topic in the seismic industry, basically since they imaged salt the first time. The Society of Exploration geophysicists alone has over 10,000 publications with the keyword salt. Salt bodies are important for the hydrocarbon industry, as they usually form nice oil traps. So there's a clear motivation to delineate salt bodies in the subsurface.
Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques can solve this problem to a large extent.TGS wants Kaggle's community to build an efficient algorithm to accurately identify if a subsurface target is a salt.

## Capstone Data 

Data : https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/data

The data is a set of images chosen at various locations chosen at random in the subsurface. The images are 101 x 101 pixels and each pixel is classified as either salt or sediment. In addition to the seismic images, the depth of the imaged location is provided for each image. The goal of the competition is to segment regions that contain salt.
